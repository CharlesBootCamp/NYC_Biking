# NYC_Biking

## Overview

### Purpose
The purpose of this assignment is to use the biking data from NYC to determine whether a bike-sharing program would do well in Des Moines; this is tested by doing the following tasks: 

- Show the length of time that bikes are checked out for all riders and genders
- Show the number of bike trips for all riders and genders for each hour of each day of the week
- Show the number of bike trips for each type of user and gender for each day of the week.

[User Checkout Time](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/charles.lash8056/viz/UserCheckoutTime/CheckoutTimesforUsers)
This analysis shows the checkout times for each of the bike rides and shows how long each ride typically lasts, by breaking it down into individual hours, it shows the number of bike rides and displays the number of riders riding for that specific amount of time, this data shows that most rides last around 5 minutes on average.

[Gender Checkout Time](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/charles.lash8056/viz/GenderCheckoutTime/CheckoutTimesbyGender)
This analysis takes the User Checkout Time information and breaks it down into the genders of the riders, given by unknown, male, or female; showing that there are many more males that ride their bikes, and for longer periods of time.

[Trips by Weekday by Hour](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/charles.lash8056/viz/WeekdayTrips/TripsbyWeekdayforEachHour)
This analysis creates a heatmap and displays the weekdays, the hours that people starting riding their bikes, and in these sections, shows how many people were riding their bikes at these specific times, which showed that most people ride their bikes before and after the standard workday.

[Trips by Gender (Weekday by Hour)](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/charles.lash8056/viz/GenderTrips/TripsbyGenderWeekdayperHour)
This analysis takes the Trips by Weekday by Hour information and breaks it down into the genders of the riders, given by unknown, male, or female; showing that males ride their bikes more often than the other groups, as well as showing that most riding occurs before/ after work on weekdays, and midday during weekends.

[Trips by Gender by Weekday](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/charles.lash8056/viz/UserTrips/UserTripsbyGenderbyWeekday)
This analysis takes the data of the types of riders, whether they're just customers or full subscribers, as well as breaking them down into male, female, and unknown. The data shown says that subscribers are more likely to ride their bikes, while also showing that men ride a lot more than the other groups, as well as the number of riders increasing as the week progresses.

[Starting Map](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/charles.lash8056/viz/StartingMap/StartingMap)
This map gives the latitude, longitude, and the number of people that started riding their bikes from certain locations, with the highest amount being 16,564 at (40.7519, -73.9777).


[Finishing Map](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/charles.lash8056/viz/FinishingMap/FinishingMap)
This map gives the latitude, longitude, and the number of people that finished riding their bikes from certain locations, with the highest amount being 16,455 at (40.7519, -73.9777), the same location as the most common starting location,.

## Summary
By using the New York City data that was gathered in August, an idea for whether or not this type of system would work in Des Moines can start to be made; however, since the data set is such a "small" amount of data over a small amount of time, more data over more time would be very preferential. One thing that was found was that the system was typically used before/after the workday on the weekdays, but it was used throughout the day during the weekends.

### Future Suggestions 
Another important piece of data that could be useful would be to find the average ages of the people using the bike-sharing program, so that it can be better advertised to groups that both do and do not use it. Another suggestion would be to try more locations around the country, NYC is one of the most population dense areas in the US, while also having major traffic issues, espcially due to the density; these factors could definitely lead to inflated growth for the company and create a false positive as to whether or not the bike-sharing program would even do well in other locations.
